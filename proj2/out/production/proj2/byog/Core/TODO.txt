本项目用的StdDraw只能识别字符，所以不能使用方向键和退格键等不能打出字符的键，但是可以使用空格键
为了能playwithInputString，不能使用与时间相关的功能，但是可以用步数
your game cannot have any mechanic which depends on a certain amount of time passing in real life
Keeping track of the number of turns that have elapsed is a perfectly reasonable mechanic,and might
be an interesting thing to include in your game, e.g. maybe the game grows steadily darker in color with each step.
You’re welcome to include other key presses like allowing the player to press space bar in order to move forwards one time step.

save and load
- :q
- Serializable
- Your game must be deterministic in that the same sequence of keypresses from
the same seed must result in exactly the same behavior every time.
- When the user restarts Game.main and presses L, the game should into exactly the same state as it was
before the game was terminated. This state includes the state of the random number generator!

Core.Game.playWithInputString(String s) must also be able to handle saving and loading in a replay string,
e.g. “N25SDDWD:Q” would correspond to starting a new game with seed 25, then moving right, right, up, right,
then quit/saving. The method would then return the 2D TETile[][] array at the time of save.
If we then started the game with the replay string “LDDDD”, we’d reload the game we just saved,
move right four times, then return the 2D TETile[][] array after the fourth move.

playGame method

WASD - The player must be able to control some sort of entity that can moved around using the W, A, S, and D keys.
These keys may also do additional things, e.g. pushing objects.

mouse pointer / door - The entity must be able to interact with the world in some way.

door - win or lose

text (wall floor door) that describes the tile currently under the mouse pointer
- A “Heads Up Display” that provides additional information that maybe useful to the user.
- Must have a HUD which displays relevant information somewhere outside of the area displaying the game world/tiles.
- HUD must display description of tile upon hovering over the tile.
HUD必须在地图之外，要用renderer的offset

测试load
playWithInputString(N999SDDDWWWDDD)
playWithInputString(N999SDDD:Q), then playWithInputString(LWWWDDD)
playWithInputString(N999SDDD:Q), then playWithInputString(LWWW:Q), then playWithInputString(LDDD:Q)
playWithInputString(N999SDDD:Q), then playWithInputString(L:Q), then playWithInputString(L:Q) then playWithInputString(LWWWDDD)


先完成上面的再做下面的

可以用空格键开启加速，WASD可以一次走两步，再按一次关闭或体力值耗尽（次数）关闭，需要再走一定次数才能启动
生成传送门的能力，有两个传送门时可以相互移动，超出两个自动销毁首个再创建
时空倒退，按一次退回十步，血量会恢复，但是传送门不会消失

Q: Can I add the ability for players to customize their character before starting a game? A: Yes,
but you’ll need to create a fourth main menu option. Your game must support exactly the API described in this spec,
i.e. “N23123S” must always start a game with the seed 23123, and must not ask for any additional input from the player.
